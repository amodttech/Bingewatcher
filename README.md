WELCOME TO BINGEWATCHER

Here is yet another personal movie rating app.  Only this time, we have a Floridian color-palette.

-----SETUP-----

1. Open the directory in terminal and run 'install bundle'

2. Enter command 'ruby bin/run.rb'

-----USER FEATURES-----
Within Bingewatcher, users can:

-Create/Delete multiple accounts to keep track of many users' watching habits using the same terminal

-Create reviews for their favorite films

-Update/Delete their previous reviews

Be gentle, it's our first time making an app.
